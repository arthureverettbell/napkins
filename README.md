An experiment in radical transparency

I will be using this repository to, among other things, archive things I have written.

Most of these are the digital equivalent of ideas written on napkins.

The nice thing about Git is that it lets me organize and revise the napkins.

The thing that sucks is that .rtf files are illegible when viewed on the browser.

I will need to figure out a better way to host text without it looking shit.
